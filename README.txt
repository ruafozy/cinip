INTRODUCTION

This software is called Cinip.  All the necessary documentation is in the
following page:

TESTS

They exist, but are currently crufty and not fully automated, so are not
maintained in the public repository.

DISCLAIMER

I've barely looked at the code before putting it into GitHub, but it's
unlikely to be representative of how I write PHP nowadays.  (Version 1.0.0
was released in 2011, the Git log to the contrary.)
